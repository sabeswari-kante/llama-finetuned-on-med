Splenomegaly (spleen palpable 4cm below costal margin). Mild scleral jaundice. Chest clear.",
    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Severe Malaria\n\nREASONING: The clinical presentation of high-grade intermittent fever with rigors, combined with splenomegaly and pallor in a resident of an endemic area, is strongly predictive of Severe Malaria. The 'bitter taste' is a common subjective report in this region. The absence of neck stiffness makes Meningitis less likely, while the spiking nature of the fever contrasts with the step-ladder pattern typically seen in Typhoid.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Typhoid Fever - Fever usually step-ladder pattern; relative bradycardia often present\n2. Sepsis - Requires identification of a specific focus (e.g., lungs, urine)\n3.

    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Severe Malaria\n\nREASONING: The clinical presentation of high-grade intermittent fever with rigors, combined with splenomegaly and pallor in a resident of an endemic area, is strongly predictive of Severe Malaria. The 'bitter taste' is a common subjective report in this region. The absence of neck stiffness makes Meningitis less likely, while the spiking nature of the fever contrasts with the step-ladder pattern typically seen in Typhoid.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Typhoid Fever - Fever usually step-ladder pattern; relative bradycardia often present\n2. Sepsis - Requires identification of a specific focus (e.g., lungs, urine)\n3. Dengue Fever - Prominent retro-orbital pain and rash; rigors are less common\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Malaria RDT/Microscopy - Gold standard to confirm presence and species of Plasmodium\n2.

Upper lobe findings (apical crepitations) are characteristic of reactivation TB. This must be distinguished from malignancy and chronic fungal infections.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Lung Malignancy - Consider in older smokers with weight loss; requires imaging\n2. Bronchiectasis - Copious purulent sputum; chronic history\n3. Pneumonia - Acute onset with high fever; usually lower lobe\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Sputum GeneXpert / AFB - The gold standard for rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n2.

    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Typhoid Fever\n\nREASONING: The constellation of 'step-ladder' fever, relative bradycardia (Faget's sign), and abdominal symptoms strongly suggests Enteric (Typhoid) Fever. The coated tongue and history of suspect food intake support this diagnosis. Unlike Malaria, rigors are typically absent, and the fever is sustained rather than intermittent.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Malaria - Fever is usually intermittent with rigors\n2. Acute Appendicitis - Pain is localized to RLQ with peritoneal signs\n3. Brucellosis - History of unpasteurized milk; undulant fever\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Blood Culture - The gold standard for diagnosis in the first week\n2. Widal Test - Supportive but non-specific; look for rising titres\n3. Stool Culture - Useful in the 2nd/3rd week of infection\n\nPLAN/REFERRAL:\n1.

The 'bitter taste' is a common subjective report in this region. The absence of neck stiffness makes Meningitis less likely, while the spiking nature of the fever contrasts with the step-ladder pattern typically seen in Typhoid.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Typhoid Fever - Fever usually step-ladder pattern; relative bradycardia often present\n2. Sepsis - Requires identification of a specific focus (e.g., lungs, urine)\n3. Dengue Fever - Prominent retro-orbital pain and rash; rigors are less common\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Malaria RDT/Microscopy - Gold standard to confirm presence and species of Plasmodium\n2.

Mesenteric Adenitis - Often follows a viral upper respiratory infection in children\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Abdominal Ultrasound - To visualize the inflamed non-compressible appendix\n2. Full Blood Count - To check for leukocytosis (elevated WBC)\n3. Urinalysis - To rule out UTI or kidney stones\n\nPLAN/REFERRAL:\n1. General Surgery - Appendectomy (Laparoscopic or Open)"

Hemorrhagic Stroke - Cannot be distinguished clinically; requires CT Head\n2. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - Symptoms resolve completely within 24 hours\n3. Hypoglycemia - Can mimic stroke ('stroke chameleon'); check blood sugar immediately\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Non-contrast CT Head - To rule out hemorrhage before starting antiplatelets/thrombolysis\n2.

Auscultation reveals an S4 gallop. Lungs are clear to auscultation.",
    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Acute Myocardial Infarction\n\nREASONING: This is a classic presentation of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). The description of 'crushing' pain radiating to the jaw, combined with autonomic symptoms (sweating/nausea), is highly specific for myocardial ischemia. An S4 heart sound suggests decreased ventricular compliance due to ischemia.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Unstable Angina - Symptoms similar but cardiac biomarkers (Troponin) remain normal\n2.

Abdomen shows guarding and rebound tenderness in the Left lower quadrant. Cervical motion tenderness is positive on pelvic exam.",
    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nREASONING: Any female of reproductive age with amenorrhea and abdominal pain has an Ectopic Pregnancy until proven otherwise. The presence of shoulder-tip pain suggests diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum (internal bleeding).

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) - Usually bilateral pain with fever and discharge; pregnancy test negative\n\nINVESTIGATIONS:\n1. Urine Beta-hCG - Immediate test to confirm pregnancy\n2.

Intense itching.\nExam: Polymorphic rash (papules, vesicles, and crusts present simultaneously). Classic 'dew drop on a rose petal' appearance (clear fluid vesicle on red base). No burrows seen.",
    "output": "DIAGNOSIS: Chickenpox (Varicella)\n\nREASONING: The description of 'dew drop on a rose petal' vesicles is pathognomonic (specific) for Chickenpox. The polymorphic nature of the rash (different stages) confirms this. Scabies would present with burrows in web spaces, not clear vesicles on the trunk.\n\nDIFFERENTIALS:\n1. Scabies - Burrows in finger webs; intense night itch\n2. Impetigo - Honey-colored crusts\n3. Measles - Koplik spots; rash is maculopapular, not vesicular\n\nPLAN/REFERRAL:\nHome Isolation - Contagious until crusted"
